# Prerequisites

This branch contains the applications needed by df to work.
Currently, there is only one prerequisite: SqlLocalDB.msi. While this can be [downloaded directly from Microsoft](https://download.microsoft.com/download/E/F/2/EF23C21D-7860-4F05-88CE-39AA114B014B/SqlLocalDB.msi), it has been included here for expediency.
